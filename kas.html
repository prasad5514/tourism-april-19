                        The fort appears to emerge from the sea. Almost three quarters of its exterior is in contact with water. Bekal fort was not an administrative centre and does not include any palaces or mansions.

                        An important feature is the water-tank, magazine and the flight of steps leading to an observation tower built by Tipu Sultan[1]. Standing at the centre of the fort, this offers views of the coastline and the towns of Kanhangad, Pallikkara, Bekal, Kottikkulam, and Uduma.

                        Madhur Sree Madanantheshwara-Siddhivinayaka Temple is a popular Shiva and Ganapathi temple located 7 km (4.3 mi) from Kasaragod town, on the banks of Mogral river, locally known as Madhuvahini.
